### Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

# Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd color-palette-recommendation-tool
# Install dependencies:

Backend:
bash
Copy code
npm install
# Frontend: Navigate to the frontend directory (if separate) and install frontend dependencies:
bash
Copy code
cd frontend
npm install
# Run the Project:

# Backend: Start the backend server
bash
Copy code
node app.js
# Frontend: Start the frontend
bash
Copy code
cd frontend
npm start
## Libraries and Frameworks Used
# Backend:
Node.js and Express.js: To create a RESTful API that serves color palette recommendations.
CORS: To enable secure API access for the frontend.
# Frontend:
React.js: To create an interactive and responsive user interface.
CSS (Vanilla): Each component has its own CSS file, maintaining clean and modular styles without external CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind.
Design Decisions
# API Structure:

The /api/color endpoint returns color data, including recommended_colors and colors_to_avoid. Each color includes metadata such as hex code and description for frontend display.
Component-Based Styling:

The project uses separate CSS files for each component, allowing for easier updates and modular design adjustments.
## User Interface for Color Selection:

Users can enter their attributes (skin tone, eye color, etc.) through form inputs. This information is then used by the backend to generate a suitable color palette.
Assumptions
Mock Data for Color Analysis:

Currently, the backend returns mock data for the color recommendations. For production, this could be replaced with a real machine-learning model or an API integration that uses color science.
Stand-Alone Server:

The backend runs independently and provides data to the frontend via API requests.
CSS-Only Design:

The UI design does not rely on CSS frameworks, opting instead for vanilla CSS to maintain simplicity and flexibility.
Project Features
Customizable Color Recommendations: Generates a unique color palette based on user characteristics.
Responsive UI: Optimized for mobile and desktop, ensuring smooth user experience across devices.
Image Upload & Color Picker: Allows users to upload an image and select colors via a dropper tool, enhancing the accuracy of the color recommendations.
Recommended & Avoid Colors: Displays two distinct color categories, helping users make informed color choices.
Future Improvements
Enhanced Recommendation Engine: Replace mock data with real-world color analysis algorithms or machine learning for more accurate recommendations.
Database Integration: Store user data and preferences for a more personalized experience.
Advanced Filters: Add more specific color attributes like warmth/coolness and seasonality.
